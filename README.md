# Hi, I'm Dani

I'm a **data-oriented developer** focused on **Python, Pandas, SQL, and professional ETL workflows**.

My GitHub is structured as a **hands-on learning environment**, built around real-world data problems, clean and maintainable code, and reproducible workflows.

I emphasize **strong programming logic**, **practical problem-solving**, and **consistent technical growth** through realistic datasets.
